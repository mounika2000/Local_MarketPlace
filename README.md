# Local-Marketplace

Local Marketplace is a single platform focused on empowering local communities and art forms.  This equips Indian travelers with a variety of local gems to shop at, providing them with a variety of comprehensive choices. 
Customers can log in and check places based on location, trusted users can also autonomously add locations not present on the website. Thus user-generated content helps gather information.

## Motivation
The following ideas have been kept in mind while developing the project:

* First and foremost, only qualified shopping centers and popular, old markets are visible in common google search.  
* The main focus of this project is to create a single to look at all events happening in the city.   
* Gathering this information and assembling would be a tedious task. Thus customers who have visited the events/ or people who know the events are happening from other sources or event organizers themselves can add the details about the same.  
* Events happening locally in an area are not well known, not available together at a single place to read and review them.  
* This application would be especially useful for tourists and short term visitors who do not have much idea about the local markets.  
* Most tourist websites only show the top 5 or top 10 best monuments/ markets to visit in the area, this application aims to show all interesting events happening there which are voted and added by customers themselves.   
* Local Marketplace would act as a one stop destination for all types of markets, events, plays,  concerts, fairs, bazaars, exhibitions, expos, sports and so on.  
* These features could be searched based on locations.  
* All events displayed would also include average customer rating and description of the event.  
* The search results displayed could be narrowed down to our choice based on the filter selected.


## Future Scope
* Include prices of locations/ markets if any.
* Fully functional review and rating system.
* Email/ push notifications about upcoming events.
* A complete ticket booking system in case of exhibitions.
* Filter which enables us to see locations within a given radius, like 5km
* Offer online hotel reservation.
* Comparison based interface for similar locations.
